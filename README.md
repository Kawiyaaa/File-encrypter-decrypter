# File-encrypter-decrypter
A file encrypter / decrypter based on XOR

Every .exe that I provide in this repository are compiled python script using pyinstaller

If your anti-virus software detect it as a virus, it isn't, it may be detected as one becuase it read the binary data of a file and build a new one from this binary data, if you don't want to take any risk, check the code of the script and build the .exe by yourslef for poratble usage 



# How to use the GUI version of the python script ? : 


1.Download python 3.9 (didn't tried the other versions)

2. Download the "FileEncrypterDecrypterGUI.py" python script

4. Execute the python script and select the file you want to encrypt / decrypt

6. Enter the name of the encrypted / decrypted file you want

8. Enter an encryption key and tadaa the file is encrypted or decrypted in the same directory of the script




# How to use the GUI compiled version of the python script ? :
